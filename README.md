## Execution

In order to tackle the daunting task of building a portfolio website from scratch, one must come up with a plan of attack. The wireframe behind this portfolio started with a crude yet effective sketch on a sheet of paper like the one below:

After the general idea was formed and put on a sheet of paper, the next task was to create a skeleton of the website through the html file. The decision was made early on to make clickable gifs that sent the user to different websites reflective of the portfolio. This was done through inspecting the console and coping the the following src= " " seen here:

 Once the structure of the html was created with appropriate semantic tags and class structures, the metaphorical meat and bones of the project began, the css. At first difficult, a combination of trial and error and massive amounts of research culminated in making a robust style.css compatable with the website.

## Result
The end product resulted in three parts.
The head of the website seen below directs the user to three sections: Bio, Websites, and Contact Info. Each button in the top part of the website seen in the first picture below navigates the user to any of the three sections of the webpage.
