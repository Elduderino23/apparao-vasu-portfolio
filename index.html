        <p>My name is Vasu Apparao and I am an aspiring full stack web developer with a background 
         in 2D Animation and Japanese language. I work well in teams and great at completing tasks both
         large and small. I am always proactive in solving problems and continually in search of new
         problems to solve in the ever changing world of web development.

         I am cum laude graduate of California State University Monterey Bay, a recipient of the 
         Louis Armstrong Jazz Award and a also an Eagle Scout from Troop 132. I am consistantly honing
         my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, SQL, MongoDB, and React.
